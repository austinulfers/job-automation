About me - very serious about this idea and willing to dedicate my time to it every day, 7 days a week and I am willing to work 10 or even more hours a day. I need a partner who is willing to do the same.

Everything about me is in my Linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgiy-kharchenko-78a213162/

I am at the point of starting something new or getting a job as a product or project manager at a start-up in the Seattle area. I prefer to stay self employed.

Ideal partner needs to be able to dedicate as much time coding as me and willing to work through all the obstacles on the way. 

Another requirement, you need to have or be able to get an Amazon MWS developer account. Without an active and up to speed MWS account, it will not work. I failed to get one. Many organizations fail to do this as well.

Technologies I am using are Visual Studio 2019 - ASP.NET C# with .NET Framework 4.6 and SQL Server 2019 stored procedures. You need to be able to program C# and write SQL Server stored procedures code along with me. We will be using Github for the version control and Trello boards for the requirements.

Site will be hosted in IIS on Windows and SQL Server 2019. I do not want to change anything. It’s great with these technologies. I will set up everything. Site will be running on Amazon AWS EC2. I can configure that as well. So as far as technology, there will not be anything fancy like  .NET core or anything other than I mentioned above. There might be some lambda involved and it’s questionable.

If anything above sounds like you need to learn something, I am sorry, I do not have time for this. You need to know everything above and ready to get started right away. So please, do not waste time, if you are not familiar with something I mentioned, it will not work out. 

Currently there is one competitor that I know and it is in the inc 5000 as well as 50 fastest growing companies in the area. Their process is broken. There are A LOT of bugs in the web site, issues with speed, delivery and many other process problems that are not possible to fix, unless they'll rewrite their site “from scratch” again. I am one of their customers. I heard that there is an army of people that’s ready to move to someone else. It’s just nothing competitive on the market right now for these people to move over. I have experience on both ends. I know a lot about this product and what customers need.

Site must be straight forward and usable for the average person. I will be able to tell where it's getting complicated so we can make it easier.

You must be good with writing. You need to know how to create a “walk me through the web site” video over the site when the background is greyed out and it walks the user through. You will need to write a lot of text as well, basic how tos, faq, terms etc… I am not born here, so English is my 2nd language. I am trying my best to write better, but I will never be on the same level as someone who is born and educated in the English speaking country.

We will have to write everything from scratch, user registration, shopping cart and site functionality. 

Before we begin our conversation, you will need to sign a non compete. If I tell you what it is, I don’t want you or anyone you know to write this code without me. This is my project and I’d like to find partner(s). Our partnership will be 50/50 so both of us have equal rights. If we bring more partners in right from the start, everyone will have an equal vote in the business. We can have as many contributing members as needed. If you know people who can help us speed things up, great! 

We will open a new LLC in DE state and bank account, where both of us or all partners will have access. All expenses that are required will need to be deposited to this bank account equally. Everything will be fair and we will have an accountant do the work. 

Obstacles that I am not able to bypass and that’s the major reasons why I need you:

I need you to be able to get an Amazon MWS developer account with ability to register and display apps in Amazon. That’s required. You need to have experience building apps for Amazon MWS in C#. That’s what is stopping me from moving forward and looking for a partner. Amazon MWS is a “black box” and many companies are having issues with it. Without Amazon MWS, we have no chance of competing with others. I need you to either have active and working MWS or be able to get one. Before we discuss anything else, I need you to show me your Amazon MWS active developer account.

Another obstacle is Walmart. I need you to be able or have an already working Walmart developer account and understand what to do with it. Walmart is full of bugs that are not being fixed for a few years now.
You need to be able to work with already or figure out eBay API as well.


You need to have some budget. We will have to split expenses - AWS hosting, s3 storage, traffic, servers, advertising etc… The best part is that it is not a lot at the beginning and after it's up and running, we will estimate the expense per customer and there will be profit starting day one. We will increase the capacity and create new modules as the company grows. There are plenty of growth opportunities. This company will be on NASDAQ if we put our minds into it.

We will need a designer, someone to create graphics and front end HTML for the project. I am not a designer and I do not know anybody. We will need to find a 3rd party consultant who will create a layout in Photoshop, slice images and apply these graphics to our .NET controls. 

Another expense will be advertising. The best advertising will be via Facebook. Expense on creating a visual is around $50 and I am thinking about finding a good advertising platform at $0.30 per click or so and spending $40 on customer acquisition. If we spend let’s say additional $50 per month per client on AWS, we will be making on average $100 per month per customer the first month and $150 per month after (that’s minimum, I used to pay $700 per month). Customer retention is the most important part and they will stay if we create a better platform compared to others. 

We can get chat reps, 24/7, live, to answer customer concerns at $3-$5 per hour in the Philippines.

If you agree to everything above, contact me ASAP and we can get started. It will take 2 programmers about 6-8 months to create and the opportunity to make money is endless.

Hi!  I have a console app which was developed by someone who is no longer here.

Groove Digital is an amazing on-line marketing company offering a complete set of online marketing tools and hundreds of hours of training for free for life. You will not be asked for a credit card or any payment at all. I accepted this offer over a year ago and upgraded at the same time to a paid account. Just yesterday I finally decided I could be proud to associate my name with this company and their products and that is what I am doing now. Yesterday I cancelled my other online business that I was paying $600 a month for so I could focus entirely on this.

There is no training as thorough as this available anywhere at any price. There are many courses available for $1000 to $2000 each that teach small pieces of what this free training includes.

You will have both the tools and the training to set up, for free, a print on demand T-shirt store, or a Shopify-like store. Or, if you are ambitious enough, the training is enough learn how to build any kind of website for yourself or for others as a business. Or you could become an affiliate marketer. There is no limit to what you could do with this free offer.

You are told that you can start a Shopify store for $49 a month. But the truth is that all truly successful Shopify stores cost $500 a month or more including plug-ins that are not really optional. Our stores are complete and require no plug-ins.

Your websites will be hosted for free for life by Groove Digital. If you want, you can purchase domain names for about $10 a year to use with your own websites.

Groove Digital even offers their own payment method so you can accept debit and credit card payments. Their rates are lower than Stripe or PayPal and they do not require stellar credit.

PayPal and Stripe limit new businesses to a maximum of about $5000 a month in gross sales. Groove Digital's limit for start-ups is $50,000 a month and their rates are lower that either Stripe or PayPal.

About 2500 people a day are accepting this free offer now and that number is growing steadily. There is an upgrade for a one-time payment or a limited number of periodic payments for those who want and can afford it. Whether you upgrade or not you will be paid commissions of over $137 whenever anyone you refer upgrades. Once you refer someone they can never upgrade under anyone else.

Click Funnels provide what are clearly the most popular affiliate marketing tools. They charge $297 a month for only 2 of the 16 tools that we offer for free. If and when the Covid-19 crisis is over, Groove Digital will end the free offer and start charging new customers $299 a month. That is still a great bargain when compared to Click Funnels.

You will need the free marketing tools to make the best of the free training.

You can learn all about these marketing tools and sign up for them if you want at my personal link below.

https://groovepages.groovesell.com/a/TXFTATyRLjqt

There is no personal link to sign up for the training at Groove Digital Academy because it is free and no commissions will ever be paid on it. Sign up at the link below.

Hello -

I'm looking for a truly knowledgeable and experienced system administrator to design and implement a Pi-Hole based network setup in my home in Kirkland. I am a software developer with a few machines at home and want to have someone who is well-qualified to come in and set up a Pi-hole system and update my DNS setup to use a local caching DNS server for all my home devices and systems to use ahead of my existing internet router and cable modem.

You really need to know what you're doing to succeed with this gig. Knowledge of Pi-hole devices, IP/TCP networking experience and DNS experience is absolutely critical.

If you're a good fit, you probably have many years of experience on Linux and/or macOS systems, and a fair amount of experience on Windows systems. 

I'm an older software engineer with about 30 years of software development experience. I would welcome having someone I can call on from time to time to help with systems administration work and perhaps some programming in Java, Perl and Linux / macOS environments.

A cutting edge new cryptocurrency technology company is looking for brilliant writers and researchers to answer questions of all kinds!

The website is 100% tip based, meaning if someone is happy with your response to their question they may but are not obligated to send you a tip. You must have a valid Bitcoin receiving address in order to accept any tips.

Currently, there are 2 open questions on the website, but as the site grows we expect this number to rapidly expand. In addition to answering questions you may also ask questions, too.

The website is reputation based, so the record of tips are public. This helps in figuring out who's worth your time to answer their question, or who's not likely to tip even if you do an exceptional job answering their question. Keep in mind tips can be of any amount, and are directly between users: There's absolutely no middleman or fees charged for using the service.

All top writers and researchers are greatly encouraged to participate in this exciting new opportunity:

Hello, I am a landlord of a small residential rental home in East Portland. I have a landlord-tenant dispute that I need legal help with.

Summary of dispute: My tenant is operating a vehicle repair business on the property (performing substantial vehicle repairs, advertising online, customers coming and going every day). This is causing issues with the neighbors, is causing environmental issues (creating huge amounts of liquid and physical waste on the property), and is causing electrical surges on the property due to the industrial power tools being used.

Ask: I am looking for a paralegal or an attorney to help serve notices and engage Multnomah County Court to proceed with eviction. Must be able to serve notices and open court proceedings.

I have a fair budget, however it is not enough of a budget to engage a brand name law firm. Please text or call me to discuss.

Thank you!    ",Paralegal Services - Tenant Dispute,https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/cpg/d/portland-paralegal-services-tenant/7221772645.html

Want to become a Founding Partner for a national Non-Profit that unites children with their parents?

Do you want to help fight the injustice of the world against children and families?

Ever wonder how a judge and the US government tear apart families without retribution? with no one stopping their illegal, criminal, and completely unConstitutional ""No Contact Orders""?

Have you or someone you know, been unable to see their children because of one of these orders?

We are looking for Founders to help start a non-profit that aims to unite families, and expose the judges for what they are: corrupt criminals.

The proposed name of the organization is GCGP, or 
""Ghosted Children & Ghosted Parents""

See the web link below:

If you are having a tough time finding work or making it, this could be a great opportunity, if you are a good fit. With millions of people out of work and struggling, there is a strong force of charity and helping others, and fighting the govt throughout America. 

One thing for sure is true about the US Government: 
They don't care about us.

Fund raising for a good cause is a great way to make a living for several reasons:
	1) Never get fired
	2) If you raise enough money, salaries of over $100k are realistic
	3) Can start part time
	4) Makes you feel good to part of something that helps people
	5) Maybe you will see your children / parents more often
	6) Who knows? If successful you could run for political office?


The work our team needs to do:
	Easy web site development using templates- just replace text and pictures with other text and pictures
	Creating marketing materials such as flyers, emails, business cards, brochures, e-newsletters
	Gathering lists of people to contact by phone, text, email
	Setting appointments for public speaking events
	Video production to get the word out on the Internet
	Fund raising through direct contact and virtual meetings

If you want to help change the world, the time is now.
America is ready for this. 
And maybe, just maybe, God wants you to help fight for justice for children and parents.

We are a non-racist, non-prejudiced, non-denominational organization.
