Im looking to hire someone to do some product design/ development for me. 
I am starting a new company that will focus on making some new kinds of in home electro mechanical devices and am unable to find anybody affordable to help me design such things.  

Open to partnership/ equity agreements and/or just straight pay. Im in the early stages of this but my concepts are compelling (I think)
There are no other products on the market like this so I think there could be a lot of upside.

Looking to make a deal with a solid mechanical engineer and get these products going.  PE is preferable

Hello,

this is a multi-purpose ad:
one ad for 5ish hrs a week: weekly email &/or basic office cleaning/organizing type work, details below.

& the other is an open ad for business/construction people of all kinds, My small biz has enormous potential ($1mil - $5million yr and much more) far beyond my ability to realize, manage or finance. I do really well solo, but nits time to expand. too much money passing me by.

My Carpentry Business in N. Seattle, has a 130+ reviews, AngiesList A+, 5 star rating. Looking for some basic email & potentially business management. 

Please, save us both some time & live around Ballard - Shoreline N. Seattle area, its better that way as i do not go south.

I am a very small general contractor, extremely busy, bursting with potential, but very little business acumen. I need a few holurs a week of email & basic business management help. Willing to pay a monthly fee, or barter carpentry work handyman work.

i already have a simple nearly idiot (me) proof system. we will not be changing anything. the hours are small, but the responsibility & seriousness are big.

What I need to get started:
1. respond to new client emails (1-2 hr per week)
2. update google with new client details (1 hr per week)
then
3. identify & separate quality/viable clients. (1 hr per week)
4. generate basic general client folders, paperwork, & billing. (1 hr per week
then)
5. interface with website ppl. audit & prep photos & videos for the website (1 hr per week)
6. potential scheduling & phone work, + plenty more detailed biz managment that needs to be done if things work out. (1-5 hrs per week)
7. &/or general office cleaning, organizing & errand running, about 3 hours a week

super easy stuff. i use only google apps, so everything is easy. 

What I can offer:

Base pay per client sale + bonus. I only make money when i haver good management in place. if its just me, i do very well, but never to potential.

I am old school, 25+ years experience, traditional career carpenter; do it right or stay home.

Clients do not pay me $10k, $20k, $100k to bullshit them, cheat, steal, lie, cut corners, or half ass anything.
I want to do things the right way, so what ever problem im solving NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. if i can...

""I am a small, traditional General Contractor, with a focus on Carpentry, Specializing in Doors & Porches, 
Beams & wall removals, structural remedies & Project Management.""

Ive been doing this stuff all my life, and probably worked about twice as much as the normal. 
Ive done everything from digging foundations by hand & rough framing on cutthroat production crews to installing doors & fixtures in hotels n motels to building BestBuys & Movie Theaters to FULL CUSTOM, no expense spared, framing sheetrock & trim in 20k sq' mansions for the rich & famous in Nashville,TN. to all phases of residential work, quality control & carpentry superintendent for $50mil golf course residential village, 5 star installer for BOTH home depot & lowes; doors, decks, fences. +/-4500 doors over 1000s of projects.

I am in 5% of my market locally here in ballard area where i live, and pass up 10x the work i actually do, leave lots of money on the table, & could have 25 guys working next week if i was smarter with business... but i absolutely HATE that part of the game. makes me ill. My potential market is several millions, JUST IN DOORS.
there are about 5o more categories i can get work in. oh yeah, this is scalable to every everett or tacoma sized city IN NORTH AMERICA.

I KNOW how to make money & monetize services.
I KNOW all the things i suck at, & ways i am a miserable failure.
I ALSO KNOW I can generate $1000 per day, BY MYSELF, with decent, halfass management. $6k/week with helper & decent management.

i do not have the intestinal fortitude to withstand the bureaucratic iron maiden of state tyranny, & the only way i can grow beyond my present state, is to open the door of opportunity i have built for the last 10 years for my son & daughter to enjoy the fruits of all my hard work; but they are not interested, so, onward we march.

i can literally go on for hours about this stuff, but im trying to keep it short.

Please respond with ""Seattle is Dying"" in the subject line so i know your a real live human bean. ;)

Millions of people have just been awakened to the fact that there is no such thing as job security anymore... it’s gone forever!

No matter how well paid, no matter the perks, no matter the prospects... they can all disappear in an instant!

So what’s the solution?

Start your own home-based business.

It’s nowhere as daunting as it sounds and once you actually take a serious look into the world of earning money from home you’ll wonder why you didn’t get involved sooner!

Earning money from home with Energetic is as simple as it can get...

We provide everything to get you started and earning from day one!

Make a decision today that you’re not leaving your future and financial security in the hands of others who don’t even know you!

Make a decision today that YOU will control your income and YOU will decide how much you should be paid every week... you can finally award yourself that rise you’ve been wanting for so long!

Oh, and did I mention that you can start your second income even while you’re still with your current job so it’s like having a safety net under you in case the worst happens and your job disappears along with its salary!    "

Hello -

I'm looking for a truly knowledgeable and experienced system administrator to design and implement a Pi-Hole based network setup in my home in Kirkland. I am a software developer with a few machines at home and want to have someone who is well-qualified to come in and set up a Pi-hole system and update my DNS setup to use a local caching DNS server for all my home devices and systems to use ahead of my existing internet router and cable modem.

You really need to know what you're doing to succeed with this gig. Knowledge of Pi-hole devices, IP/TCP networking experience and DNS experience is absolutely critical.

If you're a good fit, you probably have many years of experience on Linux and/or macOS systems, and a fair amount of experience on Windows systems. 

I'm an older software engineer with about 30 years of software development experience. I would welcome having someone I can call on from time to time to help with systems administration work and perhaps some programming in Java, Perl and Linux / macOS environments.    "
